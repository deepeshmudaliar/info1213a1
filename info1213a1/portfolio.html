    <h4>My Work Philosophy</h4>
<div id="important">
    <p>Most would describe me as a tenacious and fast learner. My philosophy is that every person should hunger for knowledge and self-improvement, and thats what I'd bring to any tech related workplace. I approach clients with respect and kindness, display active listening, and deliver the work that I say I will. Below are some quotes that I live by, through my hobbies, my social life, and my work.</p>

<br>
<blockquote> <!-- for quotes -->
    <p>
        "Pleasure in the job puts perfection in work."
    </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        "Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try."
    </p>
</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        "It is not the critic who counts. ... The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly ... who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat."
    </p>
